  A single extension with multiple features can be more beneficial than multiple extensions for several reasons.
First, having multiple extensions installed can slow down your browser and decrease its overall performance. This is because each extension uses up a certain amount of resources and having multiple extensions can add up to a significant amount of resource usage. With a single extension that has multiple features, you can still get the benefits of these features without the added resource usage of multiple extensions.
Second, a single extension with multiple features can be more convenient than having to switch between multiple extensions. Instead of having to open and switch between different extensions to access different features, you can simply use the single extension to access all of the features you need. This can save time and make your browsing experience more efficient.
Finally, a single extension with multiple features can be easier to manage than multiple extensions. Instead of having to update and manage multiple extensions, you only need to worry about a single extension. This can save you time and ensure that you always have the latest features and security updates.
Overall, a single extension with multiple features can offer a better user experience, improved performance, and easier management compared to multiple extensions

Challenges we ran into
Making an extension that performs a specific feature or is limited to a specific website is easy to build. Still, our main challenge was to combine multiple features in a single attachment. we ran into a problem with one of the features that reminds the user to take a break and stay hydrated but that feature was having some problem with scripting in js so we removed it.
other than that everything went smoothly.
